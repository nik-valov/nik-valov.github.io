    <p>The palace is contained within a 65×65×65&nbsp;m cube where blocks of varying shapes and sizes are connected by bright staircases and elevators. Each block serves a distinct function—children’s center, concert hall, discussion club, media center—using different colours and textures. The rigid crystalline grid juxtaposes dynamic and static, bringing order to multicoloured chaos. Developed with Studio&nbsp;44 through sketch, project and rendering stages.</p>
