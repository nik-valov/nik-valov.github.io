    <p>A multifunctional six‑level clinic with emergency rooms, patient rooms, a delivery room and underground operational units. Two elevators ensure vertical communication; the project assigns a common architectural identity to all elements and organizes spaces hierarchically. Designed to integrate harmoniously with the environment using local materials and sun‑protection strategies. Developed within the Zohry and Partners agency with conceptual design, space‑planning, facades, interiors and modeling.</p>
